# Goofycoin 

*Status: WIP*

A toy implementation of a cryptocurrency, as described in [Bitcoin and Cryptocurrency Technologies](http://bitcoinbook.cs.princeton.edu/).

## Install Goofycoin
```
$ git clone https://github.com/homeowmorphism/goofycoin.git
```

## Dependencies
- Python 3
- base58, ecdsa

## Security 
* Goofycoin was written as a toy project by a non-cryptographer. I did my best but I'm sure there are many security flaws that someone well-versed in the field could easily point out. 
* Goofycoin depends on the ecdsa library, which is does not protect against timing attacks. 

## Run Goofycoin
TODO

## Still Left To Do
- Move the folders around. 
- Use a full unit testing suite and understand what that's about. 
- Refactore my code/apply suggestion in code review.
