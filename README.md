# Goofycoin 

*Status: Almost done!*

A toy implementation of a cryptocurrency, as described in [Bitcoin and Cryptocurrency Technologies](http://bitcoinbook.cs.princeton.edu/).

## Dependencies
- Python 3
- base58, ecdsa

## Security 
* Goofycoin was written as a toy project by a non-cryptographer. (Enough said)
* Goofycoin depends on the ecdsa library, which is does not protect against timing attacks. 

## Still Left To Do
- Move the folders around. 
- (Would be nice to have a user interface for this but not sure what the best way to do this is.)

## Acknowledgements
Lots of people helped me on this project! I would like to thank [Jake Hickey]() for first pairing with me on this project and helping me define the backbone of the project. Thanks to Adam Kaye for showing his wallet implementation with me and helping me realize I wanted to implement the protocol part of Bitcoin! I would like to thank Andrea Law for her knowledge of networking, and telling me what needed to be on the backend. Thanks to Victoria Kirst for teaching me lots and lots about testing. Finally, thanks to all my code reviewers, (..)
